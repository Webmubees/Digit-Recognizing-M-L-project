# Digit-Recognizing-M-L-project
Welcome to our machine learning project repository focused on digit recognition using the powerful RandomForest algorithm. This project aims to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. RandomForest, known for its robustness and versatility, is employed to create an efficient and reliable classification model. Explore our codebase, experiment with the model, and contribute to advancing the realm of digit recognition in machine learning. Let's unlock the potential of RandomForest together! ðŸ¤–ðŸ”¢ #MachineLearning #RandomForest #DigitRecognition
